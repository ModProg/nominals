# numbering

This is a `no_std` compatible crate that provides number formatting for list
representations in multiple numbering systems. It was written to power the
`List` widget in [Cushy][cushy]. This crate takes some inspiration from
[Typst][typst]'s implementation of list numbering, but fresh implementations
were created to create this crate's API.

- [x] Basic formatting
- [ ] Separators
- [ ] "Any" type
