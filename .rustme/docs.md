This type of formatting can be used for list identifiers when creating ordered
lists similar to HTML's `<ol>` tag. The crate was written to power the
`List` widget in [Cushy][cushy].

This crate's original implementation was inspired by [Typst][typst]'s
implementation of list numbering. However, this crate is a fresh implementation
with newly-written implementations and types.

```rust
$../examples/basics.rs:readme$
```

## `no_std` support

This crate is `no_std` compatible, and can operate both with and without
`alloc`. Some systems, such as Chinese, require `alloc` due to reliance on
dependencies that require alloc.
